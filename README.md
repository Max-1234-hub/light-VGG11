# light-VGG11
light-VGG11 is the lightweight version of VGG11, which is used for identifying chicken distress calls and more suitable for practical deployment.

# Requirements
This is my experiment environment:
- python3.7
- pytorch+cuda11.2

# Datasets
The dataset named 'Used_AudioAndLabels.pkl'(https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Automated_identification_of_chicken_distress_vocalisations_using_deep_learning_models/20049722) contains 3,363 distress calls and 1,973 natural barn sounds with one second. Each second contains 22,050 time series points.
